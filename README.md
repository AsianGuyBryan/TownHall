#Exercise 04: Product Backlog

A product backlog is a sort of [to do list that is a important part of Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Product_backlog). 

Cards are placed into one of those categories, depending on its issue's status. Often, cards are written as **User Stories**. User stories are written from the perspective of the software *user*, such as "As a *customer*, I want to *search by product number* so that *I can find a specific item I'm looking for*." This follows the format:

> As a *role*, I want *goal* so that *benefit*

For this exercise, you will work within your groups to help build an initial list of user stories for a new product. The product will be a website that supports Free and Open Source Software project communication and backlogs. It will be sort of like a combination of an IRC channel or chat tool like [Slack](http://slack.com) and a backlog tool like [Trello](http://trello.com). We will call the product **TownHall**.

To demonstrate basic Git collaboration using the *Fork & Pull* model, you should do the following:
* One member of your team (product owner) should **Fork** this repo into one in their own space (e.g. github.com/*username*/TownHall)
* **Each** member of the team **Clone** the forked repo
* Within a file named `your-team-name.md`, each member should write at least two *user stories* for TownHall
* After you have created your 2+ user stories and are ready to add to your team's fork, **pull** updates from your team, **resolve any conflicts** with your file, then **add** your latest updates, **commit** them, and then **push** them onto your team's fork. Keep in mind that in order to push directly, the team member who make the fork will have you add you as a collaborator (within **settings**)
* After each team member has added their user stories, look at the list and the product owner (with input from the others) should **trim or revise** redundant user stories.
* When the team is happy with the revised list of user stories, **push** the latest changes to your team fork, and then create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for *this* ("upstream") repository. Once you make the pull request, you should be able to see it listed [here](https://github.com/ChicoState/TownHall/pulls).
