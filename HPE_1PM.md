- As a developer that needs to share files, I want a feature to drag and drop
files I worked on to share with the group.

- As a product owner I want a way to manage deadlines and have emails send out to other users as the deadline approaches.

- As a developer, I want to be able to chat in real time with my coworkers.

- As a developer, I want to be able to see what my coworkers are working on as they work.
